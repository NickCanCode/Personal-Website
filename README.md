# Personal Website

This is a personal website I created. It's meant to grow into more than just a portfolio - I really hope I can make it more of a personal hub. Almost like a scrapbook of sorts, or whatever.

Currently, the static website works well, but the node.js/basically the "blog" functionality doesn't work with the hosting provider for now. This will work (kinda) soon. 

Alright, I'll stop boring you lol.
