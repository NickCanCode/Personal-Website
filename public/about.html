    <h1>About Nick</h1>

    <p>Hey! I'm Nick Garrity. I'm a 15 year old based out of the New England area. I'm interested in computers (mostly
      web development, self hosting software, and working with computer hardware), as well as sports like Running and
      Lacrosse. I love music, too, and listen to a ton of Rap and a little Indie Rock. I currently am attending a local
      High School, trying to learn more about both myself and the world. <br>
      My love for computers began when I was very young. One of my first experiences with coding was at only 5 years
      old, when I did a scratch camp. For a while after that point, I only toyed with the idea of coding. A real love of
      computers began through the course of Covid-19 lockdown, when I had a lot of free time to myself. It started with
      wanting to buy a PC to play minecraft. I learned about all the parts, and eventually bought my first PC.
      Continuing down this path, I began my journey into middle school. The year was at first quite challenging, but I
      ended up doing phenomenally through the year. One thing was prominent through that year, though - that was playing
      games in class. I eventually decided to make my own website for unblocked games, and ultimately unlocked a door
      into coding that I had never expected to have. <br>
      The next summer, I learned more about HTML, CSS, and JS and became proficient enough to create fun little
      websites. In addition to coding, I ran (and am continuing to run) a successful minecraft server (which taught me
      an abundance of info about self hosting) as well as how to manage a community. <br>
      In addition to computers, I love both running and lacrosse. I am on local teams and find great joy in growing
      alongside my teammates. Photography was another great hobby I've developed more recently. Taking pictures of the
      things around me and the places I go has been a really relaxing and moving way to appreciate what I have.<br>
      I still have a long way to go when it comes to finding who I am as a person, but I'm excited to see where I go.
